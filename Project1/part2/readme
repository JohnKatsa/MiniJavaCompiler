In this folder:

	To compile: make compile
	
	To execute: make execute < input_program_file > outputFolder/output_program_file
	
(Put the output file in outputFolder folder, to avoid any possible java conflicts)
	
I have tried to make input as generic as i could. This implementation supports whatever was told in piazza, plus all valid operations can work in main (except of course identifier in function call).
